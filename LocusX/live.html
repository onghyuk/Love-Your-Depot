Locus+ and Void presents
Douglas Gordon's Portrait of Janus (divided states), the newly produced film with live performance by Okkyung Lee and in conversation with David Holmes
</p>

<p class="livetext">
    The Scottish artist Douglas Gordon's new work investigates the real and subconscious notions of boundaries, from the divided self to enforced geographical and political borders. The film uses the demarcation line of Korea’s Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), the strip of land separating North and South Korea, to trace a literal and metaphorical boundary.
The work, Portrait of Janus (divided states) 2017, tracks the DMZ border being tattooed vertically along the spine of a young Korean man, Janus Hoon Jang.
The film follows the tattooist’s needle moving down and across his skin and the motifs of the political and personal jar in a private act that is both tender and violent. The delicately balanced contradictions of the emerging image and it's meanings are haunted in real time by Okkyung Lee's improvised accompaniment; a keening, in fact.
